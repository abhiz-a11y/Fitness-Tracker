# Fitness-Tracker
Real time daily fitness checking website

Project Description

The Fitness Tracker Platform is a platform designed to help users improve their physical
well-being by tracking workouts, nutrition, goals, and progress. The platform integrates
essential fitness tracking functionalities with user-centric design and offline-first
capabilities, encouraging healthy lifestyle habits.

Objectives
● Build an fitness tracking app with a clean and intuitive UI.
● Allow users to register/login securely and manage personal profiles.
● Enable goal setting for fitness (e.g., steps/day, weight goals, calories intake).
● Log daily workouts with types (cardio, strength), time, and calories burned.
● Track nutrition with a food log (macros like carbs, proteins, fats).
● Offer personalized health tips/recommendations based on user data.
● Include social features such as friend connections, group challenges, and
leaderboards.
● Support offline functionality for logging and syncing when online.
● Prioritize user privacy and data protection with encrypted storage and
authentication.
● Enable community challenges where users can participate in events by paying a
nominal fee or registering interest. Admins can create such events or fitness
challenges (e.g., weight loss race, 10K run).

Key Features

User Management
● Sign up/login via email/password or Google
● Profile setup (age, height, weight, fitness goals)
● Role-based access (admin panel optional)

Workout Logging
● Daily workout entries (type, duration, calories)
● Predefined workouts and manual entry
● Workout history and statistics

Nutrition Tracker
● Add meals/snacks with calorie count
● Macronutrient breakdown (Carbs, Protein, Fats)
● Water intake tracker

Goal Setting & Progress Monitoring
● Set goals for weight loss, strength training, or general fitness
● Progress bars and analytics to track improvements

Community & Challenges
● Create/join group challenges (e.g., 10K steps for 7 days)
● Admins can create premium or scheduled community fitness challenges with a
nominal entry fee or open participation. These challenges can be tracked through
leaderboards.
● Leaderboards and achievements

Analytics & Recommendations
● Graphs/charts showing weekly/monthly trends
● AI-based tips: hydration, sleep reminders, workout suggestions

Privacy & Security
● User data encryption (at-rest & in-transit)
● GDPR-style data control (clear user data option)
● Secure local database using Room DB + SQLite

Offline Mode
● App functions offline with local cache
● Syncs with server when connected
